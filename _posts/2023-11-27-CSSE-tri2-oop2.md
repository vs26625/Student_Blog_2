## OOP, Game Levels

Using heirarchy below, the start screen, game screens, and game over screens have been created.

```text
GameEnv
|   ├── Attributes:
│   |   ├── levels
│   |   ├── gameObjects
|   │   └── ...
|   |
|   ├── Methods: 
│   |    ├── update: update, draw
│   |    ├── destroy: all gameObjects
│   |    └── ...
│
├── GameObject
│   ├── Player: sprite animation, wasd
│   ├── Background: fit to screen, scrolling 
│   ├── Platform: fixed to bottom, scrolling
│   └── ...
│
├── GameLevel
|   ├── Tag: key
│   ├── Attributes:
│   |   ├── playerAssets
│   |   ├── backgroundAssets
│   |   ├── platformAssets
│   |   └── ...
|   |
│   └── Methods: 
│   |    ├── load: "new" GameObject created from assets
│   |    └── ...
|
└── GameControl
│   ├── Methods: 
|   |    ├── gameLoop: drive action of game level
│   |    ├── transitionToLevel: destroys and creates objects for game level
│   |    └── ...
|   |
│   └── ...
```

### Content Setup

Each level has a tag, background, platform, player, and callback function.  These attributes will be extended over time.  Immediately, it is very apparent, description is missing elements like enemies and objects in the game.  But, this progressive structure, enables Game Control to cycle from level to level on callback completion detection. 

- start/home sequence contains entry screen of game, this level could contain all game setup: player choice, speed, leader board.
- hills would contain classic mario game level(s)
- alien would contain adapted/personalized game level(s)
- gameover should contain logic for persistence, saving state in local storage, resume at point, start over, ...  


```javascript
/*  ==========================================
 *  ========== Game Level setup ==============
 *  ==========================================
 * Start/Homme sequence
 * a.) the start level awaits for button selection
 * b.) the start level automatically cycles to home level
 * c.) the home advances to 1st game level when button selection is made
*/
GameLevel.create('start', '', '', '', startGameCallback);
GameLevel.create('home', '{{homeFile}}', '', '', homeScreenCallback);
// Game Screens
GameLevel.create('hills', '{{backgroundFile}}', '{{platformFile}}', '{{playerFile}}', testerCallBack);
GameLevel.create('alien', '{{backgroundFileAlt}}', '{{platformFile}}', '{{playerFile}}', testerCallBack);
// Test Game Screens, used during development and test
// GameLevel.create('noPlatform', '{{backgroundFileCastles}}', '', '{{playerFile}}', testerCallBack);
// GameLevel.create('noBackgroun', '', '{{platformFile}}', '{{playerFile}}', testerCallBack);
// Game Over
GameLevel.create('gameOver', '{{backgroundFileGameOver}}', '', '', gameOverCallBack);
```

### Callbacks

The callback on level currently supports advancement indicator.  The callback is continually be monitored in gameLoop and 

- store game status or game state to local storage
- capturing events in game that accumulate and store points


This below code is considered dummy code and is looking for purposefull implementation.  The callback is likely different for each game play level.

```javascript
// Level completion tester
function testerCallBack() {
    // console.log(GameEnv.player?.x)
    if (GameEnv.player?.x > 500) {
        return true;
    } else {
        return false;
    }
}
```

### Game Play

After creating GameLevel, game begins by starting the gameLoop.

```javascript
// start game
GameControl.gameLoop();
```

## Hacks: Next Steps

This "Hacks" is focused on student lessons and learning.  It is believed that the structure of the game so far is flexible and scalable.  

All (software) engineering is a progressive set of tasks, a series of design, coding, tests, an failures. Each progression may spawn new features, adapt the current design and evolve the requirements of the game (levels).  

Student Teaching tasks allow each person to adapt or extend the game.  As you work with other student teaching teams, you will cooperatively extend and grow this project.
