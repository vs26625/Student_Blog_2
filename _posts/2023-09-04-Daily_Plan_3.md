- Monday: DAY OFF (Labor Day).
- Tuesday:  Open the notebook in teacher repository "javascript-output-jquery-ipynb" and study the format. Present Live Review for Student Notebook (Time Box) check (1.9/2).
- Wednesday: Customize [Snake Game](http://localhost:4200/student//2023/08/31/Snake_Game.html) to have apples, circles, and different colors. Still learning how to separate the Snake from Apple
- Thursday: We talked and planned out our summary for the Pair Showcase. We update our weekly plans, summary, and hacks and review tickets. We also went to ChatGPT to experiment and investigate how to separate the snake from the dot. After many failed attempt and days of trying, we still havent found a solution.
