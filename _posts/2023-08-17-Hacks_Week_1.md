> ## Hacks Learned
> Key Learnings.  It is very important that you become fluent in " Vocabulary" and researching problems.

- Learned more sets of code such as mark (used to highlight text), git clone (clones repository), _config.yml (settings for blog), index.md (home page of blog), relative path (the url of a photo...used to add photos to your blog), and how to change themes of my blog.

- Learned to create markdown table on home page. Was previously called "Weekly Updates" and consisted of what I struggled with, my accoplishments, the hacks I learned, and tangibles. (Most information from previous table was moved to Lab Notebook).
