> ## Hacks Learned
> Key Learnings.  It is very important that you become fluent in " Vocabulary" and researching problems.

- Learned basic sets of code such as wsl (type of coding source I use for my computer), cd (change directory {file}), help (provides code), clear (clears code in terminal), mkdir (make directory), rmdir (remove directory), and dir/ls (see what is in directory).

- Learned what each tool is used for such as vscode (used to code my blog), command prompt/powershell (used to code in general), vscode terminal (used to save codes in my blog and to code in general), and github (used as a code history to save all your codes).
