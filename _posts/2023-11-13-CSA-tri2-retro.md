## Key Indicator Grading and Retrospective
This review includes requirements from both written and verbal instructions that were provided during **Sprint 4**. The term "retrospective" in agile development is an opportunity to make things better.

An agile retrospective is an opportunity for agile development teams to reflect on past work together and **identify ways to improve**. Agile teams hold retrospective meetings after a time-boxed period of work is complete (typically a sprint lasting two to four weeks). During the retrospective, the team discusses what went well, what did not go as planned, and how to make the next work period better.


### Team Grading Prep (25 minutes)
This **"retrospective" to "ideation"** week will be used for teams to improve their work (retrospective) and transition into design (ideation) for the Two Trimester passion projects.

**Review Ticket Content**. Teams will provide the Teacher with a "Review Ticket" to capture scores, plans, highlight projects, what went well, and what needs improvement.

**Utterance Comment**. Team review ticket will be an Utterance comment on this blog.

**Crossover Grades**. Teams / Individuals will crossover grade another team. In the process of development, we often use this type of review to broaden our perspective.


### Review Ticket Header
Use the templates below to **assist in grading and retrospection** with Review Ticket. This Table is an illustrative summary of the most important information between Student development teams and Teacher.

### Crossover Grade (25 minutes)

Teams / Individuals will perform crossover grading.
  - **Crossover Scrum Master grading**. Scrum Master Team A grades Scrum Master Team B. Place grading in the Header of Review Ticket according to the template. Also, perform individual crossover grading on each other. Be sure to be retrospective.
  - **Crossover individual grading**. Grade individual by individual (Team A to Team B), if there is an odd person working in a trio. Be sure that I know the name of each grader and who you are grading (i.e., John M grading of Shane L)
  - **After grading is complete**, Scrum Master or Individuals update scores on top of the review ticket. Scrum Master reviews sources for completeness and makes sure the addition is correct.


### Final Grading
Teacher Grading will consider any change to the final 0.1. Note, this would be considered both in meeting guidelines of the project or extra credit.

- **Retrospective improvement**. Teams and individuals will have time to make improvements during the week.   
- **Indicators in Crossover are final**. Do not change scoring after these initial indicators are made. This will be considered "doctoring",
- **Extra credit**. If there are concerns about score, understanding, or completeness in this process... It is possible to add to seed. Individuals will be responsible to come up with action.

#### Key Indicators Team Template (1 Point)
