> Nore, Soni, and I made a google docs plan to plan for this entire love review. We also did mock testing to prepare for the review.
When working on customizing our snake game, we found out how to apply the apple to the game. 
However, the cloud computer doesn't allow you to copy paste emojis on VSCode so it only works on my blog.
We also added a picture of us to our home page.
All our hacks, daily plans, and review tickets are up to date containing summaries of our accomplishments. 
We have also checked in on slack for any new announcements and coding hacks.
GitHub is also up to date with all our edits.
