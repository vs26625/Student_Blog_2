> Update on how this week went
> I struggled with my Sprite having different amounts of frames for each command. I also struggled with the speed at which my spirte sheet was going. Our team used a function called "timeStamp" which lowered the speed rate. Our sprite sheets are now fuctioning properly. For the Web Programming, we were struggling with understanding what each of the topics were talking about. We eventually learned the subjects it was talking about by sharing bits and pieces of what we each indiviually knew and learning what we didn't know from our teammates. We struggled with the "Basics of JS with HTML" since it wouldn't show up in notebooks, we had to move it to a post. I was also confused with the "1-4 js code errors" when it asked to list the alphabet since when I put "i<26" it would repeat the alphabet so I had to set it to 0. I also had trouble with understanding what a list was and thanks to some help from the TA's, I now understand what it is.
