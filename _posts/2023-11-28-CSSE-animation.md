## Player Animation Improvements
Make a lesson and code around Parallax.  Integrate ideas so they can be adapted by Teacher project. 

Improve animations and movements of player.

- Idle Animation, idle(). Add an idle animation that plays when the player is not moving.
  - Include subtle movements to make the character appear more dynamic.
  - Transitioning Movement, moveLeft() and moveRight()

- Gradually transition from walking to running animations based on the duration of key presses.
  - Implement a deceleration effect when the player stops moving.

- Attack Animation attack(). Create an attack animation/scene that plays when the player interacts with enemies.
  - Implement logic to avoid enemy kills through proper timing of attacks.
