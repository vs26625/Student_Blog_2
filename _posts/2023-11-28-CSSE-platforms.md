### Spawning and Synchronization
Make a lesson and code around jumping onto platforms.  Integrate ideas so they can be adapted by Teacher project. 

Provided in code is the beginning of a tube obstacle.   This is a new GameObject class.  Review logic to detect when the player interacts with the obstacle.  This ultimately triggers a Callback that ends the level.

Introduce platforms for jumping and avoiding enemies.  Obtain coins and scoring points.
