We learned how to code Javascript inside a webstie's (or VSCode's) "Console." I have linked what we learned inside the Hacks Summary and the Daily Plans for this week.
There wasn't really much we did other that learning Javascript this week. We did try to edit our calculators. Nora and Soni were able to fix the buttons but when I try what they did, VSCode has a problem with the @import command in my calculators code. Everything else is up to date with Slack, GitHub, and my Blog, though.
