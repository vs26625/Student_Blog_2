## Passion Project Ideation

Looking for the following...

- Big idea. Looking for useful or analytical solution to my delima of Collaboration and usage of Java.  Turn something you see into passion.
- Frontend/JavaScript. Initial Ideation must contain Front end screens or user interactions.  
- Backend Data/Java.  Their must be APIs, Data design or UML diagram that describes how data will be stored.  Since Java is a big focus, we should consider Data elements that cover all the FRQ types: Methods and Control Structures, Class(s), Arrays/ArrayList, and 2D Arrays.
- Collaboration. Since this project is on Collaboration there needs to be a work plan.  That workplan should explain how you intend to progrss Frontend and Backend independently.  For instance, usage of postman on backend and hardcoded data JSON data according to API definition on Frontend.  Additionally, you should have features assigned to Pairs or Individuals according to needs for research, development, and equity.
- Suggestion for optimal efficiency in Team.   Add something to your project that can be used to support Popcorn Hacks in your Unit 1-10 lesson.
- Libaries or Frameworks.  Consider what key library(s) or framework(s0) you will add to your project.
