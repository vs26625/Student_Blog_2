### Spawning and Synchronization
Make a lesson and code around Enemies and Obstacles.  Integrate ideas so they can be adapted by Teacher project. 

Provided in code is the beginning of a tube obstacle.   This is a new GameObject class.  Review logic to detect when the player interacts with the obstacle.  This ultimately triggers a Callback that ends the level.

NPC Characters shoud extend Character
Introduce new NPC GameObject class for Goombas.  Implement game logic for NPC movement and collision with the player.

Collision Detection:
- Implement collision detection between the player and enemies.
Assign points based on successful interactions, considering the type of interaction (e.g., jumping on a Goomba versus colliding with a Gomba).
