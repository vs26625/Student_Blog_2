- Monday: DAY OFF (Pro-Grow Day!).
- Tuesday: Fix [Javascript Calculator](http://127.0.0.1:4200/Student2//2023/09/19/Javascript-Calculator.html) from being in a singular column to being in a grid.
- Wednesday: Customize [Javascript Calculator](http://127.0.0.1:4200/Student2//2023/09/19/Javascript-Calculator.html) to fix grid from being just a plain grid to functioning buttons.
- Thursday: Try to finish sprite sheet
- Friday: Continue to de-bug sprite sheet and create better frame rate code
