> ## Summary of Accomplishments
> Update on how this week went

> This week, my and my partners started work on out jupyter notebooks/time valuts. 
My computer has changed the link from 0.0.0.0 on my website to http://127.0.0.1:4200/student/ which works much better. 
However, I used to be able to reload my page but that has stopped working. The proccess of created our blogs didn't as many set backs as the 0th and 1st week since we now know and understand more code than before. 
My blog home page now has a photo of me and my partners. I did take out the original markdown table from week one (it was called "Weekly Updates") since we are now recording our activities on our jupyter notebooks. 
My hacks normally have links to assignments that we do in class and a summary of the week. 
My time vault is up to date with all the daily plans we did, hack summarys/assignments, and this review of the week.
Under annocements, there was an annocement for adding an apple to our snake game. However, while I was able to change the colors of my snake game (in 25 mins), I was unable to identify where to add the apple. 
My GitHub pages are also up to date with my repository. Since we got a new student repository, I was able to access the actions button (on Student2) and was able to see my syncs. With the help of Mr. Mortensen, I was also able to fix my GitHub to commit my builds in GitHub (it wouldn't go through at).
