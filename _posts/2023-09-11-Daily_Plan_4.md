> ## Plan for Unit 2 / Week 4
> Overall: New codes and understanding calculators/console
- Monday: Copy Calculator to Pages. Fix pages to thoroughly sync to GitHub (Change it from syncing to Student to syncing to Student2) and learn about that the Calculator Review Check is.
- Tuesday: <mark>MINIMUM DAY!!</mark> Since my teammates are out at Unity Day, I am left to mess around with the Calculator and understand its parts. I also, last night, realized my server wasn't updating so with the help of Mr. Lopez, I was able to fix it by deleting what was in the Calculator.
- Wednesday: Changed theme to minima! Used gem "minima" in the Gemfile and renamed default.html to base.html.
- Thursday: We learned how to use [javascript Data Types](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/teacher/basics/datatypes) using "Console" in websites.
- Friday: We learned how to use Console in GitHub under the notebook Javascript-output-object in th teacher repository
