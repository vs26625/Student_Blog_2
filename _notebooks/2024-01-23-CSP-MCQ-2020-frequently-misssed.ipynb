    "A color in a computing application is represented by an RGB triplet that describes the amount of red, green, and blue, respectively, used to create the desired color. A selection of colors and their corresponding RGB triplets are shown in the following table. Each value is represented in decimal (base 10).\n",

    "A binary triplet is a set of three binary numbers. Binary numbers are numbers that are represented by a series of 1's and 0's. Binary numbers are used in computers because they are easy to represent with electrical signals. A binary RGB triplet is a set of three binary numbers that are used to represent a color, from example question above...\n",

    "#### How do you convert a binary triplet to a decimal number?\n",
    "To convert a binary string to a decimal number you need to multiply each digit by its place value. For example, if you have the binary string 1010 you would multiply the first digit by 2^3, the second digit by 2^2, the third digit by 2^1, and the fourth digit by 2^0. This would give you the decimal number 10. To convert a binary triplet to a decimal number you need to multiply each digit by its place value. For example, if you have the binary triplet (01101110, 11111111, 10010110) you would multiply the first digit by 2^7, the second digit by 2^6, the third digit by 2^5, the fourth digit by 2^4, the fifth digit by 2^3, the sixth digit by 2^2, the seventh digit by 2^1, and the eighth digit by 2^0. This would give you the decimal number 110, 255, 150.\n",
