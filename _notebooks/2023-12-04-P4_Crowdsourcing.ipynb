    "\n",
    "    - This is typically done via the **internet**.\n",
    "    - A few examples of projects that utilize crowdsourcing are ***Wikipedia*** and ***Fiverr***, as they rely on input from internet users in order to display information or advertise independent services. Furthermore, companies like companies like ***LEGO***, ***PepsiCo***, ***Starbucks*** and ***Fisher-Price*** all utilize crowdsourcing to recieve <mark>input from their customers</mark> and <mark>create better products/enhance consumer experience</mark>.\n",

    "- Literally! According to Amazon Web Services (AWS), <strong>distributed computing</strong> can be defined as the method of making multiple computers work together to solve a common problem. A few examples can be seen below:\n",

    "        - <mark>Protein folding</mark>: Proteins are long chains of amino acids, and they tend to fold a certain way. But sometimes, they can fold the wrong way, leading to problems like cancer, Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease. To help fight this, project Folding@Home sends bits to volunteers' computers all around the world to distribute the computing power and increase processing efficiency. This came with the PlayStation 3 back in the day.\n",
    "    - <mark>BOINC - University of California, Berkeley</mark>:\n",
